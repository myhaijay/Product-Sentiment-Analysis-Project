#### Problem Statement/ Business Objective
Every business is ultimately motivated by profit maximization. And this is a direct function of the feedback that she gets from those using her product - whether it's a tangible product or some service.
Consiquently, understanding these feedbacks from her customers and using that to make informed decision is paramount. 

Using Amazon as a case study, this project explores many many thousands of product reviews from customers using Natural Language Processing, to analyse and get the overall sentiments(emotions) of the users concerning the products, using Machine Learning.


#### Steps in Analytic Approach
* Data importation and exploration
* Data wrangling and cleaning
* Cross validation across several Classification Algorithms
* Build the model
* Build an app for user interaction using Streamlit
* Connect app to MySQL database for faster processing

#### Specific Interest
* Scrapping real-time data(reviews) and get the sentiments of the customers about a product.


In this project I worked with Python to carry out all the processes of Maching Learning in NLP and build a model,
MySQL to interact with the database to store the predictions of overall product sentiments and I also used Streamlit for to create User Interface for better interaction.
